-   16 single-ended (SE) or eight differential (DIFF) analog input channels. -- Req single-ended
-   Two analog output channels.
-   Analog input data in two basic modes – software paced and hardware paced.
-   Sample rate in software paced 33 S/s to 4000 S/S.
-   Sample rate in hardware paced is 500 kS/S aggregate. -- Req 500 kS/S aggregate
-   The input voltage range is software selectable for ±10 V, ±5 V, ±2 V, or ±1 V. -- Req config
-   The two 16-bit analog outputs can be updated simultaneously at a rate of 250 kS/s.
-   One output can be updated at a rate of 500 kS/s.
-   The output range is fixed at ±10 V.


What is fixed:
-   input: 500 kS/S aggregate - single-ended
-   output: triangular wave
What is configurable:
-   input: voltage range ±10 V, ±5 V, ±2 V, or ±1 V
-   output: frequency and amplitude
